This is a light laptop, seriously light (don't worry the body is aesthetic and strong enough to take in a few blows) 2. It has 2 freaking thunderbolts where most laptops don't even have a single one. 3. The touchpad / numpad is primary beauty focus point I'd say (you can control the touchpad / numpad's brightness. Yes, it has a dynamic setting) 4. The keyboard is then again backlit keyboard so there's nothing new in here. 5. The bezel's are nice, sleek and seriously three way narrow bezels are good, the very reason ASUS did not go with a 4 way narrow bezel is because ventilation is provided below the screen, hence the screen is protected in the long run from the heat. 6. The key travel is equivalent to an average HP or a Dell's laptop so you don't basically have to get adjusted to this new machine's end-to-end keyboard, I had no issues in typing the minute I typed the first word. 7. The battery lasts literally a whole day. It really does. ( I am on fedora 32 and on 25% brightness at 90% battery the I get a battery to last about 15 hours and 92% battery on windows with 25% brightness, balanced-mode I usually get a 12 hours backup)  The Cons:- 1. The touchpad can get in the way of the typing since your wrists may touch it, well it may or may not be with you but to get around it you do get the F6 function key to disable touchpad, so I guess that's a great option. 2. You may say that this machine gets heated but it's such a sleek yet compact machine that I'd say it's natural but with active fans and ergonomic lift you get a proper ventilation. 3. The speakers could have been on top for better sound but that would have only make it uglier but anyway the speakers are mediocre but sufficient.  Software:-  I am using dual booted Fedora32 + pre-installed windows system  The Pros (Linux) :- 1. You get a working out the box system in linux. Yes it does contain a intel wifi card which has an active support in since linux kernel 5.3+ versions 2. The bluetooth drivers works out of the box well. 3. With powertop and tlp and reasonable cutbacks on background process one can get 18-20 hours of juice out of this machine for sure. 4. Keyboard backlight works right out of the box in linux kernel 5.7+ versions  The Cons (Linux) :- 1. Touchpad / Numpad gestures won't work out of the box. Just use libinput-gestures or a wayland version. 2. Intel-generic drivers of wifi may or may not provide the best of the speed but upgrade to the latest version just in case.  Note: Everything works right out of the box smoothly in Windows and it is a seamless experience over there.  Overall this is a great laptop for programming and productivity and with this price it seems like best option. Since it's a just-launched product the overall linux support may take a few months.\",\n",
       " \"Amazing laptop!  Most amazing thing: Battery life!!  I get 10-12 hours on medium to heavy use Wifi and Bluetooth On!!! This is insane! I use it like a phone. Charge it at night and use it for the entire day! Charges very quickly in under an hour.  Performance wise there's obviously no complaints. Its more than enough for most of the people doing serious work. Its incredibly fast. Face unlock works well. Screen is absolutely amazing. Its incredibly lightweight. Speakers are the loudest and clearest that I have ever heard on a laptop.  Webcam quality is surprisingly good considering this is a laptop! Its comparable to macbooks.  You get manual control of fan (kind of). Laptop can get warm if you are working and fast charging at the same time but you can set fan performance to max and it really helps with the cooling.  I don't think any other product is available at this price with these specific features in India. Just go for this one.  PS- before buying this, I had an asus Vivobook 14. loved it and used it for a long time. Had no problem. So I think Asus as a laptop brand is very reliable.\",\n",
       " \"Update after 6 weeks ------ No complaints so far. I haven't experienced any issues and all my comments in the original review below continue to be valid.  Battery life is consistently strong at 10 hours workday average with some video streaming. I don't do any heavy work on this machine and keep brightness around 40% so this is probably the best you can get from this battery pack. Recharging is awesome and I love the battery protection features that only charge the battery to 60%/80% to improve its life. Charging is rock solid and it generally charges from 10% - 80% in around 1 hour with the supplied charger.  I'm enjoying the screen also. The extra 0.7 inches over a 13.3 laptop doesn't sound much on paper but in practice it makes a significant difference. At Full HD resolution it means I don't have to scale the display size in Windows and everything remains readable at 100% scale. On the 13.3 inch Zenbook I always set the scale factor between 105-107%. I don't have to do that on this 14 inch UX425.  Other great things that I've seen since the original review. The microSD card reader is so much faster vs. the one in my old Zenbook UX305. This one gives 70mbps / 50mbps with UHS-3 cards which is awesome.  The speakers are louder than I initially thought. In a quiet bedroom I only need to keep them around 60% to be comfortably audible. At 100% they can be loud enough for a moderately noisy environment. Works perfectly for calls and for occasional audio-based work tasks.  I disabled the Intel graphic app from starting up on launch and that has fixed the auto-dimming feature which was an annoyance. The idea of that feature is to improve battery life, but even after disabling it the batter stays the same for me. It's probably because I keep brightness between 30-50% anyways. However, by disabling the auto-dimming feature the display remains more comfortable for me.  The ports are awesome. Perfectly placed and they suffice for me without any extra dongles or docks.  The form factor continue to be awesome. The 1100gm weight means I often use the laptop balancing it in one hand for short tasks and it's great because I can move around. Obviously not for anything over 10 mins, but often that's enough to do short tasks.  No complaints and I would recommend it if you find it at the right price.  Asus launched the new Zenbook range globally, and it should hit India by early next year. For now, I think this is the best fit for my purpose from a price/performance/feature/reliability standpoint.  Original review - Aug 2020 ------- I have been waiting to upgrade my 2016 Zenbook but in the last 2 years ASUS has been disappointing with their Zenbook line features. This release finally gets the combination of most important things right.  Core i7 with 16GB RAM, bright enough screen, matte anti reflective screen, smallet form factor, lighter weight than 2016 version.  Most importantly, they finally have universal USB-C fast charging, Thunderbolt 3 ports, and an excellent keyboard+touchpad. I have been using the laptop for 3 weeks and I made the right choice to wait for this 2020 line to be launched.  When you spend nearly 1 lac on a laptop you don't want to compromise on little things. And this new Zenbook makes very few trade-offs.  1. The screen is nearly perfect - 14-inch screen provides enough real estate for efficiency on the go. The color balance is decent. The matte anti-reflective coating is fairly light so it stops reflections but the picture quality remains fairly high. Brightness is good at 300nits but Asus also have a 400-nit 1W screen which unfortunately wasn't launched in India. 400 nits would be a better option at this price. I don't like 4K screens on my work laptop because they cut the battery life significantly so this is fine. I also don't need a touchscreen on a work laptop.  2. The form factor is ideal for travel ultrabook - small, light at 1.13kg and fairly durable. There is some flex in the middle of the frame which feels strange as the 2016 Zenbook felt rock solid with its metal unibody. But overall the laptop feels durable enough and helps with the lighter weight. Metal unibody designs are more solid of course but they are also heavier.  3. The battery is superb. After about 2 weeks of use I have consistently seen around 10 hours in Windows battery report. This is with 40-50% brightness, office work and some video playback. The Corei5 version should give better endurance but this is perfect for my use case. The 2016 Zenbook Corei5 was giving around 7-8 hours so this is a good jump for Core i7.  3. The charging is fantastic. I can plug any USB-C charger from 5V to 20V and the battery will charge (at proportionate speed). That's an amazing convenience when traveling. I tried a mobile power bank, a mobile charger, an Anker 45W PD charger and they all charge the laptop (at different speeds). The charging brick from Asus is compact but is a 2 piece so there is a rather bulky power cord for India. The 2016 Zenbook was a single piece charger that plugged directly in the wall socket. It's not a huge problem because this charger is going to stay at home and for travel will carry a universal mobile charger. Fast charging is also super useful for traveling.  4. The keyboard is top-notch. The main reason I chose the 14-inch version over the 13-inch is because of the more spacious keyboard. Again essential for a work laptop if you don't want strained fingers. There are 3 levels of white backlighting and the touchpad is classic Zenbook - big, wide and feels premium. I don't use the integrated number pad too often but when I do it works well.  5. Sound - Good enough to watch a movie or take a call in a quiet room and that's all I need. I use Bluetooth headphones/speakers at other times so the lack of a headphone jack doesn't bother me. Asus does include a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box, so that's great! The speakers are reasonable for an ultrabook so I am happy with the performance. They are not dismal like you will see on Vivobook X403 for example.  6. Fan speed - this may not be a huge deal for most people but I absolutely needed a quiet laptop. I was spoilt by the 2016 version and the 2020 Zenbook doesn't disappoint. The fan is mostly quiet for 80% of the workday and spins up only when you are doing any demanding installs, editing etc. I tried a Yoga 640 and damn that thing was noisy as hell!  7. Webcam - fine for doing work calls but is pretty average quality. At least it's in the right spot and the mics are high quality.  8. Color - I would have preferred the silver color but Asus only offers this Pine Grey color in the 14-inch version. I wasn't willing to make that trade-off because the keyboard is slightly more cramped on the 13-incher. It's a premium looking color but silver does look more premium on an ultrabook.  That's all! I'm very happy with my upgrade after 3 weeks of use. Asus also offers an 1 year extended warranty (total 2 years) for $20 so that's useful.  I tried a Lenovo Yoga in June and was sorely disappointed. The build quality was average, the fan was damn noisy, battery life was unpredictable, the ports were a disaster (no thunderbolt, no charging, no HDMI) and I received a faulty screen from Lenovo.com.  Asus Zenbooks have MUCH higher quality specially for professional use so I am never buying or recommending LENOVO if you are spending more than 60K on a laptop.  I was finally happy to let my old Zenbook go for this new model! It's almost perfect.\",\n",
       " \" I have been using a Lenovo laptop since last 3 years. This laptop came around just during my search for a new one, loved the specifications and design, Asus has done good job with this and this is the only 11th Gen Laptop in India right now.  Hardware -  Pros -  1. This laptop is very light, with a great weight distribution throughout the laptop.  2. It has 2 Thunderbolts where most laptops don't even have a single one and both are Thunderbolt 4 ports.  3. The touchpad which also acts as a numpad is nice and you can control the numpad's brightness.  4. The keyboard is a backlit keyboard and the key travel is good.  5. The bezel's are very sleek and nice.  6. The battery lasts literally a whole day. 😅  7. Comes with a nice laptop sleeve.  Cons -  1. The webcam could have been better.  2. They could've provided an audio jack, but they provided one type c to audio jack with the laptop.  Overall this is a great laptop for programming and productivity and with this price it seems like best option.\",\n",
       " \"This laptop is has been used for 3 days and heavy usage, both on power and battery while writing this review. I did video editing using Blender on this and the laptop did pretty fine, considering only Iris plus graphics.  Laptop is for people who are - frequent travelers, need long battery life, prefer a slim form-factor but doesn't want to sacrifice all the power/performance.  CONs first - 1. NO dedicated 3.5 mm headphone jack. Instead you are provided with a usb-C to 3.5mm high definition dongle. Although many people use bluetooth speakers, still there are many who use 3.5mm. For now they are saved by the dongle. 2. This applies only to me, as I use a thinkpad with 2mm key travel. Shallow keypad with depth of 1.4mm. 3. Touchpad is a not centered so accidental right hand click is possible. Although never happened for me so far.  PROs are many - 1. Sleek, beautiful color and shape. 2. Very good build quality (brushed aluminium) with military standard robustness (drop test, etc.) 3. Very very good touchpad which is very wide and excellent palm rejection. It is also one of the smoothest one in the market. 4. wide keyboard. so allows good typing. And I love getting back the dedicated Home, end, pu, pd keys. 5. Double thunderbolt port, with HDMI and USB-A (5Gbps), micro sd reader. One thunderbolt hub will suddenly make this have 10+ ports. 6. Quick charging usb-c, and long battery life. Even while video editing it lasted 4+ hours before coming to 30% 7. 300+ nits display IPS-level, and 100%sRGB. Although I need to test the sRGB claim. and it has pretty good viewing angles for an IPS-level. 8. Wifi 6, IR cam for face recognition  Others - Sound is good enough for the slim profile, but could be better. Had to adjust the audio wizard. But this could be also because I'm used to Dolby. Finger detection could have been given.\",\n",
       " 'Very thin and light laptop with ports like HDMI, USB type C thunderbolt 3 and Normal USB port (type A), it was great to see a LAN connector within the box. Also there was a connecotor for Type C to 3.5 mm jack for Headphones.',\n",
       " \"key highlights are explained already in description and other reviews. nice features are fantastic (lightweight, great display, nice touchpad, nice keypad, good battery life, nice speakers for a slim laptop, office 2019 preinstalled) and a few points that may put off some users (no touch screen, no 3.5mm jack for audio).  but here are a few points I wanted to highlight besides above  1. Please note a key difference w.r.t battery life claims vs what you will get. the battery claims have been made with a different product variant - that has a 1Watt display. what you get is a 2.5Watt display. so you will never see the 22hr claims, but 10+hrs is sure for typical usage of productivity & consumer activity like browsing and streaming or even coding (no heavy gaming, high brightness on display). but the key to this 10hr battery life is the 67Whr battery. that is 50% more than typical laptops, but who cares as long as the product is thin & light.  2. WiFi is bad if you are away from router. in the same location (30ft from router), with an older generation zenbook (UX430UA) , I have no issues, but with this one (UX425EU) I have issues and frequent disconnects from router. This is a consequence of the think &light form factor and poor antenna placement.  3. for some strange reason, I cannot find the option to enable adaptive display brightness. one reviewer mentioned that disabling intel graphics command center at startup fixes this, but it didn't work for me  4. the corei5 version has only 80EU Graphics and not 96EU. you cannot upgrade the memory  5. by visiting asuspromo.in I paid rs999 and extended warranty to 3yrs total. I strongly recommend to use this option  6. myasus app has many options to configure the product to your requirement. please go through all the options, play with it and settle for what works for you. for example, I never charge my battery to 100%.  overall, I highly recommend this product. I exchanged my 10yr old macbook air for this one and have no regrets about it.\",\n",

It has a special number key pad built into the mouse pad and is useful for working with numbers (managing accounts etc). It comes with MS Office and also an Anti Virus valid for one year. Asus also provides options to purchase additional one year / two year warranty beyond the standard one year. Overall, I'm a satisfied customer.\",\n",
       " \"Play Video  Best configuration business laptop.  I have been searching for laptops with following features: Light weight, Metal body, 14' display, 512 SSD, Intel 10th gen processor, Bigger battery and good design.  Last couple of months it was difficult to order one with above features as all the laptops were getting out of stock. I waited and got to know that ASUS's new series of Zenbooks are launched on 31st of July. I saw couple of reviews in YuoTube and ordered this one on 1st of August.  I was planning to buy the intel-i5+8GB RAM model but with extra 15K better to go for i7+16GB RAM for faster and better battery performance.  Note: Before unboxing please check the model number on the box. Because I had a hard to figure it out whether I got the correct laptop. The model no. on my box was UX425JA and back side of the box all the specs were correct. But when I opened it the laptop had a Zenbook 13 sticker (mini heart attack). Before removing the sticker I took a measuring tape to check the display size and found out it 14' screen. After pealing of the sticker inside the laptop I saw ASUS ZenBook 14 branding near the touch pad. ASUS misplaced the sticker during packaging.\",\n",

Product description should be accurate especially for High value products like this. Laptop is basically good. Battery lasts around 10 hours for basic surfing. Few ports only - 1 USB, 2 thunderbolt type C and 1 HDMI. Laptop is light weight and good design. Amazon inspection service was marked wrongly as completed even though it was not done.

       " \" Using this laptop for past 10-15 days. Here's my view: Pro's: -> Excellent display . Screen is of premium quality with great color reproduction and good brightness level. I mostly used it indoors with 40-50% brightness level when room is lit and 20-30% in dark room. -> Premium looks and light weight. Definitely pleasing to eye design and professional looking and great build quality. -> Speed. This thing is fast like almost comparable to entry level macbooks(in my opinion). Right from startup to sleep to awake and opening apps. Though i used it for basic browsing and streams and movies most of the time. Nvme ssd and lpddr4x ram is what contributes to its speed. -> Audio is crisp and clear with good loudness. I see few commenting as speaker is not loud but for me its loud enough for my liking -> Touchpad is big and smooth with support to all windows gestures. -> Charging speed is great it charges above 50% in 40 min with 67W charging brick also its a usb type c charger so no need to carry it seperately if u have high speed usb c mobile charger. ->In box u will get laptop sleeve with is nyc and looks good but drawback is it doesn't have pouch to carry charging brick.  Con's: -> first and major con is battery life. Dont get me wrong its still a good battery but not as good as advertised. In amazon it shows 22hr backup but on i5 11th-gen it has 15hr battery sticker and still i was not able to get battery above 8hrs with moderate usage. I have updated all drivers set to battery health to balanced mode. -> No headphone jack and that's kind of sad to see even in laptop its being removed, there's should have been headphone jack but Asus does provide hi-res Usb C to audio jack connector. ->Auto dimming of screen. One suggestion was to disable intel graphics command to disable at startup but still after that screen changes brightness timebto time and there is no auto brightness option in power plan. ->Touchpad is great but bit too big. For some people it may come in between of typing. It should have been pf regular size ->Ports: Has less ports so if you have multiple pendrives and connectors then port dongle is must which would cost you 2-3k . For now its sufficient for me as i only use USB mouse sometimes.  Other things: -> Didn't face any heating issue but laptop did get bit hot on top side when windows is updating. -> You need to register in asus promo website if you want to avail extra year warranty for rs 999/- . This needs to be done within 15 days of purchase, meed to upload Invoice and serial number copy (both can be downloaded from amazon desktop site). -> MS office 2019 is included with software which you need to register in Microsoft site  Will be updating my review after couple of months after using it for basic coding alone with some development tools.  Update1: Battery life sucks and i dont know if this is the issue with only my unit , but i get atmost 5-6 hrs of battery. All my drivers and bios are updated and windows was reset to see if it solves the issue but nope. Just to give you perspective at the time of this comment my battery is at 44% with battery life showing 2 hours 17 min and it gets worse if you use multiple applications with draining as high as 50% in 1hour.\",\n",

However, in reality, MS office Home and Student 2019 edition is not installed on this laptop. When I contacted Amazon customer service to complain, they agreed with my complaint but advised me to contact ASUS. I contacted ASUS customer service via phone as well as email, but got the response that MS Office Home and Student edition is not included with this laptop and I need to buy the license from Microsoft (although it is mentioned on the box in which this laptop was delivered that MS Office Home and Student edition 2019 is included). I'm very disappointed with Amazon and ASUS for this experience. Why is it mentioned on Amazon website that the license is included? Why is neither of them taking responsibility?\",\n",

Can't blame the software as Microsoft did a thorough analysis of the logs and verified the different drivers and gave a thumbs up for the software. Funny thing is that it bricks out even when I do not run anything on it. I switched on the laptop and waited for 20 minutes without opening even a new notepad, and it froze indefinitely. I am trying to return it within the window for replacement and the Amazon tech desk is unable to send anybody soon due to technically acknowledge that there is a problem with COVID guidelines to be followed which is understandable. However, I hope Amazon don't say that, I missed the window for return due to the technician delay from their end as the laptop can be returned only after the technician says there is a fault :-). This is going to be the last time I will order a high value item on Amazon and order it from known vendors even if it is expensive than Amazon. As I am unable to return this without verification as this costs more than 1 Lakh rupees despite me paying it in a single payment.\",\n",

Hang problem - It hangs very frequently and sometimes black screen for few moments (it's < 1 sec but it's the problem).  I was really happy in 1st month but now I am regretting my decision of buying it . You can't work on laptop which hang in middle of something it really frustrating.

Battery Backup is 8 Hours while doing all the official work. (5-6 hour) we can expect any given time with multiple files, tabs n MS running. in 11th gen, there is Baklight keypad And Intel Iris Xe Graphics instead UHD (as mentioned). Iris is updated one, So, That's Good. SSD literally boost up the machine; like 3-4 soconds (i mean it) is the boot time. Damn! 8GB DDR4 makes sure multiple files run smoothly.  i read reviews before i recieved the machine and i was worried about build quality. BUT, keep in mind that You are buying a Laptop and NOT a Hammer. body is of light Alluminium And not of Plastic (it seems so; Feels So! well i haven't figured this out yet, But..)... Well, You Need a Performing Laptop i.e. a Gadget, and Not a Weapon. They say it heats up. Man, it IS a Machine And it Will heat while running several files. What You gotta do, is to Take Care of it... Never Ever use Laptop On Bed, Sofa, Lap, or some other cloth or cusion under it.. It Needs Vantilation to blow the heat out.. Always use it on a plane Table n Nothing under it... i Repeat NEVER ON BED OR SOFA. n if possible, use it right under the fan or in front of cooler (not to mention AC as its understood). Take Care of your machine n it'll keep performing as New..!  Great Performing Machine with the Trust of hp.  Have Fun!\",\n",

Overall I would say built quality is average, there won't be any issues with day to day work.. What I liked the most bout this lappy is the display it's very crisp and sharp display with good colour contrast.. Pros:- 1. Backlit keyboard- Has backlit keyboard with brightness adjustment and I personally use laptop at night for programming and other college work so I wanted this feature. 2. I bought model no. Hp 15s fq2535TU and in this model it was shown in specifications that it has UHD intel graphics which is wrong this model has Intel Xe graphics which is obviously better and newer than old UHD graphics. 3. And yes before buying note that this model doesn't have fingerprint which I knew before ordering and I personally don't have any issue with it..( Shown that it has fingerprint in specifications which is wrong) 4. Sound quality is also good and now coming to CONS... 1. Battery backup is just OK It has like 3-4 hours of backup on heavy work like watching HD content and doing other heavy work (Not gaming), But with normal usage it will last around 5-6 hours maximum..  Summing-up I would say Overall this is the best laptop for professional works, programming and other normal surfing stuffs Very good performance,everything is just up to the mark,very well done HP👍🏻,and yes this is not a gaming laptop and I personally don't play games so can't say anything about gaming.. Thanku Peace Out✌️😁\",\n",

Its 12.4\" PixelSense touch screen (not that useful for non-360 rotating display) with 3:2 ratio with average, not great, resolution i.e. 1536x1024 (even Surface Go 2 have 1920x1080 display).

       " \"This laptop is perfect for home and student use. Don't get blindsided by the negative reviews. The item arrives in sturdy packaging which prevents it from damage during transit. I myself use this laptop for university online meetings. This laptop is not meant for high graphics gaming, low-resolution games are compatible. Rest assured is fine.  Benefits: - Heat: No heating issue. While charging only the charging adapter and battery gets warm which is quite normal. - Charging time: Gets charged in 2hr 30mn (0-100). Playback time (normal usage)- 4 hrs. - Boot time: 10 secs switch-on & switch-off. - Writing speed: USB 3.0 (output to input) gives 80-120 Mbps writing speed. - Display: FHD display, Antiglare display lets you stream Netflix, Youtube & many more from any angle of the laptop. - Sound: Based on a laptop system, the sound is quite good. I hear music at volume 40/100. - Touchpad: smooth. - Pre-activated Office 2019.  Note: - Purchase a Saco silicon keyboard cover (black) as the visibility of the default key prints in daylight are not so efficiently visible.  - As shown in picture, the laptop must be kept above any plain hard surface so that the air circulation keeps running and does not gets heated.  - In many reviews, you will find that the laptop is getting heated, the worst laptop and all. But one must know how to use it properly.  - At first, I was thinking of purchasing the same model only with Ryzen 3 4300U processor. But I changed my decision and stuck to this only. Because as compared to 4300U, in this laptop 3250U one gets 15.6 Screen, RJ-45 Port, 1TB HDD, calculator keyboard.  - Don't confuse yourself with the processors, someone will say quad-core is better than dual-core, and don't purchase this laptop as it is dual-core. But trust me for home and student basic usage, this laptop is more than enough.  - If one plays a game or performs multi-high tasking software, then the laptop fan runs at high speed which is a bit noisy. But don't worry its normal only.  - DDR4 2400 mghz is sufficient for a student and basic office meetings use.  - Do check the warranty on HP's official website by entering the serial number which is present at the laptop base or product box.

If it is helpful, I would like to mention one more point that while buying I had opted for exchanging my old laptop to get some discount... amazon was offering 9.75K flat discount.

Windows is  installed in SSD so the loading time (from turned off to start) is near about 5-7 seconds. Usable Ram is around 5.86GB. 8GB is installed in one slot so another one is free to get another ram installed.  • It is very light. It doesn't have a CD drive.

Windows (of course), all the drivers update, Office 19' so you can use it right  away! • It doesn't have a keyboard backlight.  In short, as I said, at this price this is the best.

Firstly The day when Laptop was supposed to come, Laptop didn't come because it was sent to other are of city. So it got delayed for a day. Secondly,the Delivery Person who was also the person for inspection of my precious laptop exchange was utter Arrogant and was pointing at non existing problems with my old laptop. He didn't even have basic knowledge of Hardware and Software of Laptops and still Amazon had sent this incompetent person for inspection and Laptop pick up. Had to talk with his senior for the delivery of new laptop. Now Coming to laptop,the first 3 days laptop ran really Smoothly. It had no problems whatsoever with any softwares at all. But suddenly one day it wasn't showing any Wifi. The wifi symbol in taskbar was gone. Even in Network settings Wifi wasn't visible. I did Troubleshooting and also checked for Wifi drivers. Wifi driver wasnt at all visible. And Troubleshooting didn't help at all. Now Laptop is frozen at this state and isn't going ahead. I don't know whether it's Software problem or Hardware fault but this is worst experience even after spending Hefty Amount of Money 🤦\\u200d♂️. Hence I would say don't buy laptops from Amazon. Rather buy them from Company's Official Store and Website. And I would add avoid Acer Laptop and rather buy HP Laptops as after sells services are far better and experience is also better.

I have attached a video of the issue I faced with this Laptop.  The issue started within a month from the date of purchase. I lodged my first complaint.  At first, the service technician took my laptop to Acer Service Center-Hyderabad for more than a week and returned with the assurance that all the defective parts were replaced with new ones.  But then again the same issue repeated within a month and I lodged a complaint with Acer. Now it's been almost two weeks that they are not able to attend to the issue and resolve.  This has affected my activities a lot. So if you are buying this Laptop be ready to sacrifice your work and keep chasing Acer service persons.  It's definitely not a value for money for me. I am not able to assess whether it's a good laptop or no.

       " \"I have been using a HP laptop since a year and since I was a linux power user it posed a lot of problems, mainly in the drivers section. This laptop came around just during my search for a new one. To be honest ASUS had outdone themselves on this one and this truly is a beauty to have in your hands.  Hardware Section :-  The Pros:- 1. This is a light laptop, seriously light (don't worry the body is aesthetic and strong enough to take in a few blows) 2. It has 2 freaking thunderbolts where most laptops don't even have a single one. 3. The touchpad / numpad is primary beauty focus point I'd say (you can control the touchpad / numpad's brightness. Yes, it has a dynamic setting) 4. The keyboard is then again backlit keyboard so there's nothing new in here. 5. The bezel's are nice, sleek and seriously three way narrow bezels are good, the very reason ASUS did not go with a 4 way narrow bezel is because ventilation is provided below the screen, hence the screen is protected in the long run from the heat. 6. The key travel is equivalent to an average HP or a Dell's laptop so you don't basically have to get adjusted to this new machine's end-to-end keyboard, I had no issues in typing the minute I typed the first word. 7. The battery lasts literally a whole day. It really does. ( I am on fedora 32 and on 25% brightness at 90% battery the I get a battery to last about 15 hours and 92% battery on windows with 25% brightness, balanced-mode I usually get a 12 hours backup)  The Cons:- 1. The touchpad can get in the way of the typing since your wrists may touch it, well it may or may not be with you but to get around it you do get the F6 function key to disable touchpad, so I guess that's a great option. 2. You may say that this machine gets heated but it's such a sleek yet compact machine that I'd say it's natural but with active fans and ergonomic lift you get a proper ventilation. 3. The speakers could have been on top for better sound but that would have only make it uglier but anyway the speakers are mediocre but sufficient.  Software:-  I am using dual booted Fedora32 + pre-installed windows system  The Pros (Linux) :- 1. You get a working out the box system in linux. Yes it does contain a intel wifi card which has an active support in since linux kernel 5.3+ versions 2. The bluetooth drivers works out of the box well. 3. With powertop and tlp and reasonable cutbacks on background process one can get 18-20 hours of juice out of this machine for sure. 4. Keyboard backlight works right out of the box in linux kernel 5.7+ versions  The Cons (Linux) :- 1. Touchpad / Numpad gestures won't work out of the box. Just use libinput-gestures or a wayland version. 2. Intel-generic drivers of wifi may or may not provide the best of the speed but upgrade to the latest version just in case.  Note: Everything works right out of the box smoothly in Windows and it is a seamless experience over there.  Overall this is a great laptop for programming and productivity and with this price it seems like best option. Since it's a just-launched product the overall linux support may take a few months.\",\n",
       " \"Amazing laptop!  Most amazing thing: Battery life!!  I get 10-12 hours on medium to heavy use Wifi and Bluetooth On!!! This is insane! I use it like a phone. Charge it at night and use it for the entire day! Charges very quickly in under an hour.  Performance wise there's obviously no complaints. Its more than enough for most of the people doing serious work. Its incredibly fast. Face unlock works well. Screen is absolutely amazing. Its incredibly lightweight. Speakers are the loudest and clearest that I have ever heard on a laptop.  Webcam quality is surprisingly good considering this is a laptop! Its comparable to macbooks.  You get manual control of fan (kind of). Laptop can get warm if you are working and fast charging at the same time but you can set fan performance to max and it really helps with the cooling.  I don't think any other product is available at this price with these specific features in India. Just go for this one.  PS- before buying this, I had an asus Vivobook 14. loved it and used it for a long time. Had no problem. So I think Asus as a laptop brand is very reliable.\",\n",
       " \"Update after 6 weeks ------ No complaints so far. I haven't experienced any issues and all my comments in the original review below continue to be valid.  Battery life is consistently strong at 10 hours workday average with some video streaming. I don't do any heavy work on this machine and keep brightness around 40% so this is probably the best you can get from this battery pack. Recharging is awesome and I love the battery protection features that only charge the battery to 60%/80% to improve its life. Charging is rock solid and it generally charges from 10% - 80% in around 1 hour with the supplied charger.  I'm enjoying the screen also. The extra 0.7 inches over a 13.3 laptop doesn't sound much on paper but in practice it makes a significant difference. At Full HD resolution it means I don't have to scale the display size in Windows and everything remains readable at 100% scale. On the 13.3 inch Zenbook I always set the scale factor between 105-107%. I don't have to do that on this 14 inch UX425.  Other great things that I've seen since the original review. The microSD card reader is so much faster vs. the one in my old Zenbook UX305. This one gives 70mbps / 50mbps with UHS-3 cards which is awesome.  The speakers are louder than I initially thought. In a quiet bedroom I only need to keep them around 60% to be comfortably audible. At 100% they can be loud enough for a moderately noisy environment. Works perfectly for calls and for occasional audio-based work tasks.  I disabled the Intel graphic app from starting up on launch and that has fixed the auto-dimming feature which was an annoyance. The idea of that feature is to improve battery life, but even after disabling it the batter stays the same for me. It's probably because I keep brightness between 30-50% anyways. However, by disabling the auto-dimming feature the display remains more comfortable for me.  The ports are awesome. Perfectly placed and they suffice for me without any extra dongles or docks.  The form factor continue to be awesome. The 1100gm weight means I often use the laptop balancing it in one hand for short tasks and it's great because I can move around. Obviously not for anything over 10 mins, but often that's enough to do short tasks.  No complaints and I would recommend it if you find it at the right price.  Asus launched the new Zenbook range globally, and it should hit India by early next year. For now, I think this is the best fit for my purpose from a price/performance/feature/reliability standpoint.  Original review - Aug 2020 ------- I have been waiting to upgrade my 2016 Zenbook but in the last 2 years ASUS has been disappointing with their Zenbook line features. This release finally gets the combination of most important things right.  Core i7 with 16GB RAM, bright enough screen, matte anti reflective screen, smallet form factor, lighter weight than 2016 version.  Most importantly, they finally have universal USB-C fast charging, Thunderbolt 3 ports, and an excellent keyboard+touchpad. I have been using the laptop for 3 weeks and I made the right choice to wait for this 2020 line to be launched.  When you spend nearly 1 lac on a laptop you don't want to compromise on little things. And this new Zenbook makes very few trade-offs.  1. The screen is nearly perfect - 14-inch screen provides enough real estate for efficiency on the go. The color balance is decent. The matte anti-reflective coating is fairly light so it stops reflections but the picture quality remains fairly high. Brightness is good at 300nits but Asus also have a 400-nit 1W screen which unfortunately wasn't launched in India. 400 nits would be a better option at this price. I don't like 4K screens on my work laptop because they cut the battery life significantly so this is fine. I also don't need a touchscreen on a work laptop.  2. The form factor is ideal for travel ultrabook - small, light at 1.13kg and fairly durable. There is some flex in the middle of the frame which feels strange as the 2016 Zenbook felt rock solid with its metal unibody. But overall the laptop feels durable enough and helps with the lighter weight. Metal unibody designs are more solid of course but they are also heavier.  3. The battery is superb. After about 2 weeks of use I have consistently seen around 10 hours in Windows battery report. This is with 40-50% brightness, office work and some video playback. The Corei5 version should give better endurance but this is perfect for my use case. The 2016 Zenbook Corei5 was giving around 7-8 hours so this is a good jump for Core i7.  3. The charging is fantastic. I can plug any USB-C charger from 5V to 20V and the battery will charge (at proportionate speed). That's an amazing convenience when traveling. I tried a mobile power bank, a mobile charger, an Anker 45W PD charger and they all charge the laptop (at different speeds). The charging brick from Asus is compact but is a 2 piece so there is a rather bulky power cord for India. The 2016 Zenbook was a single piece charger that plugged directly in the wall socket. It's not a huge problem because this charger is going to stay at home and for travel will carry a universal mobile charger. Fast charging is also super useful for traveling.  4. The keyboard is top-notch. The main reason I chose the 14-inch version over the 13-inch is because of the more spacious keyboard. Again essential for a work laptop if you don't want strained fingers. There are 3 levels of white backlighting and the touchpad is classic Zenbook - big, wide and feels premium. I don't use the integrated number pad too often but when I do it works well.  5. Sound - Good enough to watch a movie or take a call in a quiet room and that's all I need. I use Bluetooth headphones/speakers at other times so the lack of a headphone jack doesn't bother me. Asus does include a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box, so that's great! The speakers are reasonable for an ultrabook so I am happy with the performance. They are not dismal like you will see on Vivobook X403 for example.  6. Fan speed - this may not be a huge deal for most people but I absolutely needed a quiet laptop. I was spoilt by the 2016 version and the 2020 Zenbook doesn't disappoint. The fan is mostly quiet for 80% of the workday and spins up only when you are doing any demanding installs, editing etc. I tried a Yoga 640 and damn that thing was noisy as hell!  7. Webcam - fine for doing work calls but is pretty average quality. At least it's in the right spot and the mics are high quality.  8. Color - I would have preferred the silver color but Asus only offers this Pine Grey color in the 14-inch version. I wasn't willing to make that trade-off because the keyboard is slightly more cramped on the 13-incher. It's a premium looking color but silver does look more premium on an ultrabook.  That's all! I'm very happy with my upgrade after 3 weeks of use. Asus also offers an 1 year extended warranty (total 2 years) for $20 so that's useful.  I tried a Lenovo Yoga in June and was sorely disappointed. The build quality was average, the fan was damn noisy, battery life was unpredictable, the ports were a disaster (no thunderbolt, no charging, no HDMI) and I received a faulty screen from Lenovo.com.  Asus Zenbooks have MUCH higher quality specially for professional use so I am never buying or recommending LENOVO if you are spending more than 60K on a laptop.  I was finally happy to let my old Zenbook go for this new model! It's almost perfect.\",\n",

       " \"This laptop is has been used for 3 days and heavy usage, both on power and battery while writing this review. I did video editing using Blender on this and the laptop did pretty fine, considering only Iris plus graphics.  Laptop is for people who are - frequent travelers, need long battery life, prefer a slim form-factor but doesn't want to sacrifice all the power/performance.  CONs first - 1. NO dedicated 3.5 mm headphone jack. Instead you are provided with a usb-C to 3.5mm high definition dongle. Although many people use bluetooth speakers, still there are many who use 3.5mm. For now they are saved by the dongle. 2. This applies only to me, as I use a thinkpad with 2mm key travel. Shallow keypad with depth of 1.4mm. 3. Touchpad is a not centered so accidental right hand click is possible. Although never happened for me so far.  PROs are many - 1. Sleek, beautiful color and shape. 2. Very good build quality (brushed aluminium) with military standard robustness (drop test, etc.) 3. Very very good touchpad which is very wide and excellent palm rejection. It is also one of the smoothest one in the market. 4. wide keyboard. so allows good typing. And I love getting back the dedicated Home, end, pu, pd keys. 5. Double thunderbolt port, with HDMI and USB-A (5Gbps), micro sd reader. One thunderbolt hub will suddenly make this have 10+ ports. 6. Quick charging usb-c, and long battery life. Even while video editing it lasted 4+ hours before coming to 30% 7. 300+ nits display IPS-level, and 100%sRGB. Although I need to test the sRGB claim. and it has pretty good viewing angles for an IPS-level. 8. Wifi 6, IR cam for face recognition  Others - Sound is good enough for the slim profile, but could be better. Had to adjust the audio wizard. But this could be also because I'm used to Dolby. Finger detection could have been given.\",\n",
       " 'Very thin and light laptop with ports like HDMI, USB type C thunderbolt 3 and Normal USB port (type A), it was great to see a LAN connector within the box. Also there was a connecotor for Type C to 3.5 mm jack for Headphones.',\n",
       " \"key highlights are explained already in description and other reviews. nice features are fantastic (lightweight, great display, nice touchpad, nice keypad, good battery life, nice speakers for a slim laptop, office 2019 preinstalled) and a few points that may put off some users (no touch screen, no 3.5mm jack for audio).  but here are a few points I wanted to highlight besides above  1. Please note a key difference w.r.t battery life claims vs what you will get. the battery claims have been made with a different product variant - that has a 1Watt display. what you get is a 2.5Watt display. so you will never see the 22hr claims, but 10+hrs is sure for typical usage of productivity & consumer activity like browsing and streaming or even coding (no heavy gaming, high brightness on display). but the key to this 10hr battery life is the 67Whr battery. that is 50% more than typical laptops, but who cares as long as the product is thin & light.  2. WiFi is bad if you are away from router. in the same location (30ft from router), with an older generation zenbook (UX430UA) , I have no issues, but with this one (UX425EU) I have issues and frequent disconnects from router. This is a consequence of the think &light form factor and poor antenna placement.  3. for some strange reason, I cannot find the option to enable adaptive display brightness. one reviewer mentioned that disabling intel graphics command center at startup fixes this, but it didn't work for me  4. the corei5 version has only 80EU Graphics and not 96EU. you cannot upgrade the memory  5. by visiting asuspromo.in I paid rs999 and extended warranty to 3yrs total. I strongly recommend to use this option  6. myasus app has many options to configure the product to your requirement. please go through all the options, play with it and settle for what works for you. for example, I never charge my battery to 100%.  overall, I highly recommend this product. I exchanged my 10yr old macbook air for this one and have no regrets about it.\",\n",

       " \"Play Video  Best configuration business laptop.  I have been searching for laptops with following features: Light weight, Metal body, 14' display, 512 SSD, Intel 10th gen processor, Bigger battery and good design.  Last couple of months it was difficult to order one with above features as all the laptops were getting out of stock. I waited and got to know that ASUS's new series of Zenbooks are launched on 31st of July. I saw couple of reviews in YuoTube and ordered this one on 1st of August.  I was planning to buy the intel-i5+8GB RAM model but with extra 15K better to go for i7+16GB RAM for faster and better battery performance.  Note: Before unboxing please check the model number on the box. Because I had a hard to figure it out whether I got the correct laptop. The model no. on my box was UX425JA and back side of the box all the specs were correct. But when I opened it the laptop had a Zenbook 13 sticker (mini heart attack). Before removing the sticker I took a measuring tape to check the display size and found out it 14' screen. After pealing of the sticker inside the laptop I saw ASUS ZenBook 14 branding near the touch pad. ASUS misplaced the sticker during packaging.\",\n",

But wrong product description given as upto 22 hours which is for i7 10th Gen model. Am surprised by this misleading description and called Asus customer care to know the difference. Product description should be accurate especially for High value products like this. Laptop is basically good. Battery lasts around 10 hours for basic surfing. Few ports only - 1 USB, 2 thunderbolt type C and 1 HDMI. Laptop is light weight and good design. Amazon inspection service was marked wrongly as completed even though it was not done. Customer care later scheduled new inspection',\n",
       " \" Using this laptop for past 10-15 days. Here's my view: Pro's: -> Excellent display . Screen is of premium quality with great color reproduction and good brightness level. I mostly used it indoors with 40-50% brightness level when room is lit and 20-30% in dark room. -> Premium looks and light weight. Definitely pleasing to eye design and professional looking and great build quality. -> Speed. This thing is fast like almost comparable to entry level macbooks(in my opinion). Right from startup to sleep to awake and opening apps. Though i used it for basic browsing and streams and movies most of the time. Nvme ssd and lpddr4x ram is what contributes to its speed. -> Audio is crisp and clear with good loudness. I see few commenting as speaker is not loud but for me its loud enough for my liking -> Touchpad is big and smooth with support to all windows gestures. -> Charging speed is great it charges above 50% in 40 min with 67W charging brick also its a usb type c charger so no need to carry it seperately if u have high speed usb c mobile charger. ->In box u will get laptop sleeve with is nyc and looks good but drawback is it doesn't have pouch to carry charging brick.  Con's: -> first and major con is battery life. Dont get me wrong its still a good battery but not as good as advertised. In amazon it shows 22hr backup but on i5 11th-gen it has 15hr battery sticker and still i was not able to get battery above 8hrs with moderate usage. I have updated all drivers set to battery health to balanced mode. -> No headphone jack and that's kind of sad to see even in laptop its being removed, there's should have been headphone jack but Asus does provide hi-res Usb C to audio jack connector. ->Auto dimming of screen. One suggestion was to disable intel graphics command to disable at startup but still after that screen changes brightness timebto time and there is no auto brightness option in power plan. ->Touchpad is great but bit too big. For some people it may come in between of typing. It should have been pf regular size ->Ports: Has less ports so if you have multiple pendrives and connectors then port dongle is must which would cost you 2-3k . For now its sufficient for me as i only use USB mouse sometimes.  Other things: -> Didn't face any heating issue but laptop did get bit hot on top side when windows is updating. -> You need to register in asus promo website if you want to avail extra year warranty for rs 999/- . This needs to be done within 15 days of purchase, meed to upload Invoice and serial number copy (both can be downloaded from amazon desktop site). -> MS office 2019 is included with software which you need to register in Microsoft site  Will be updating my review after couple of months after using it for basic coding alone with some development tools.  Update1: Battery life sucks and i dont know if this is the issue with only my unit , but i get atmost 5-6 hrs of battery. All my drivers and bios are updated and windows was reset to see if it solves the issue but nope. Just to give you perspective at the time of this comment my battery is at 44% with battery life showing 2 hours 17 min and it gets worse if you use multiple applications with draining as high as 50% in 1hour.\",\n",

What I liked the most bout this lappy is the display it's very crisp and sharp display with good colour contrast.. Pros:- 1. Backlit keyboard- Has backlit keyboard with brightness adjustment and I personally use laptop at night for programming and other college work so I wanted this feature. 2. I bought model no. Hp 15s fq2535TU and in this model it was shown in specifications that it has UHD intel graphics which is wrong this model has Intel Xe graphics which is obviously better and newer than old UHD graphics. 3. And yes before buying note that this model doesn't have fingerprint which I knew before ordering and I personally don't have any issue with it..( Shown that it has fingerprint in specifications which is wrong) 4. Sound quality is also good and now coming to CONS... 1. Battery backup is just OK It has like 3-4 hours of backup on heavy work like watching HD content and doing other heavy work (Not gaming), But with normal usage it will last around 5-6 hours maximum..

Benefits: - Heat: No heating issue. While charging only the charging adapter and battery gets warm which is quite normal. - Charging time: Gets charged in 2hr 30mn (0-100). Playback time (normal usage)- 4 hrs. - Boot time: 10 secs switch-on & switch-off. - Writing speed: USB 3.0 (output to input) gives 80-120 Mbps writing speed. - Display: FHD display, Antiglare display lets you stream Netflix, Youtube & many more from any angle of the laptop. - Sound: Based on a laptop system, the sound is quite good. I hear music at volume 40/100. - Touchpad: smooth. - Pre-activated Office 2019.  Note: - Purchase a Saco silicon keyboard cover (black) as the visibility of the default key prints in daylight are not so efficiently visible.  - As shown in picture, the laptop must be kept above any plain hard surface so that the air circulation keeps running and does not gets heated.  - In many reviews, you will find that the laptop is getting heated, the worst laptop and all. But one must know how to use it properly.  - At first, I was thinking of purchasing the same model only with Ryzen 3 4300U processor. But I changed my decision and stuck to this only. Because as compared to 4300U, in this laptop 3250U one gets 15.6 Screen, RJ-45 Port, 1TB HDD, calculator keyboard.  - Don't confuse yourself with the processors, someone will say quad-core is better than dual-core, and don't purchase this laptop as it is dual-core. But trust me for home and student basic usage, this laptop is more than enough.  - If one plays a game or performs multi-high tasking software, then the laptop fan runs at high speed which is a bit noisy. But don't worry its normal only.  - DDR4 2400 mghz is sufficient for a student and basic office meetings use.  - Do check the warranty on HP's official website by entering the serial number which is present at the laptop base or product box.

But since my old laptop was damaged a little in the hinge area and the laptop plastic body, the exchange offer got cancelled totally later during pick up.',\n",
       " \" It's just amazing! Let me get the details here:  At this price it will be the best buy for office/casual use, average gaming (Haven't played any high res games yet).  • It has 1 SSD 256GB and 1 HDD of 1TB. Windows is  installed in SSD so the loading time (from turned off to start) is near about 5-7 seconds. Usable Ram is around 5.86GB. 8GB is installed in one slot so another one is free to get another ram installed.  • It is very light. It doesn't have a CD drive. Honestly, I don't think anyone use any CD these days. If you use disk then you need to get a usb disk drive. Everything is pre-installed. Windows (of course), all the drivers update, Office 19' so you can use it right  away! • It doesn't have a keyboard backlight.  In short, as I said, at this price this is the best. Trust me, I investigated on Croma, HP world etc. to see if I get any better model (HP) at this price but I failed.\",\n",

Build is solid and premium looking and the internal speakers are pretty good. I had a Dell laptop before this n its speakers wasn't this good. Battery lasts about 6 hrs. Only thing is when connected to external speakers, the sound is not evenly distributed. I mean the left speaker is slightly louder than the right. It wasn't like this with my previous laptop. Display is very good. It boots n shuts down very fast. I don't know about the camera coz I don't have a frame of reference but when I tested just for the sake of it, it seemed ok.

DELL should have included fast charger and the battery capacity should have more at least 6hrs would worth the price tag.  WIFI: It comes with WIFI5.
